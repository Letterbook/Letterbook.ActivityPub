# Letterbook's ActivityPub library

There are two primary goals with this project.

1. Type safety. This is dotnet, and we're acting like it.
2. Spec conformance. This will implement the AP spec as fully and faithfully as possible.

Once those two goals are met, we'll focus on performance optimizations and supporting major protocol extensions.
