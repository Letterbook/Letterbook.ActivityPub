# Letterbook's ActivityPub library

There are two primary goals with this project.

1. Type safety. This is dotnet, and we're acting like it.
2. Spec conformance. This will implement the AP spec as fully and faithfully as possible.

Once those two goals are met, we'll focus on performance optimizations and supporting major protocol extensions.

## Usage

This package is still in active development, and may change. It may be useful to you as-is, but you should not consider ci builds to be stable at this time.

## Contributing

This library is part of the Letterbook project. For now, see the [Letterbook Repository](https://github.com/Letterbook/Letterbook) for contributing guidelines and Code of Conduct.
